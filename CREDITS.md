## Intro
Although I put a lot of solo work into this project, I definitely could not have done it myself. My attempt at pixel art was a glorious failure, 
I wouldn't know where to begin if I tried to make my own music for this game, and of course I needed many, many Google searches and YouTube videos
to help accomplish things I wasn't sure how to approach. This document is to acknowledge the works of others that were kind and generous enough to offer
their talent and production freely to the world so that we can all have a chance to imagine and create things we otherwise wouldn't be able to.
