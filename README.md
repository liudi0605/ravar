# 2D Monster RPG

This project is a currently unnamed 2D monster catching RPG. It is modeled after the popular style of tile-hopping, turn-based monster fighters that many of us
grew up playing obsessively.

## About

This game is set in a 2D fantasy world modeled after a famous region. Most of the details are purposefully vague at this point to leave flexibility in the story
design later. Currently the game is in Build 1.0.1 with only very basic functionality and placeholder art. The character can walk around the world, trigger
random battles with enemy monsters, and battle until one of the monsters is downed.

## Install

This project uses Unity, which is currently the only way to install/access the game until a demo version is released.

## Controls

Character movement: Up/Down/Left/Right arrows or W/A/S/D keys

Action: Z

## Roadmap
